# Himax Touch 85x Controller Driver for Windows
In this repository you can find the Himax Touch 85x controller driver for Windows (KMDF).
This driver supports Himax 8520 and 8526 touch controllers.

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/theR4K/SynapticsTouch for the base and modified to work with Himax digitizers.

## Disclaimer
This driver is not finished.
It contains debug code and might be missing comments as well.
Tracing has been replaced with KdPrintEx for various reason making development easier on some versions of Windows.

Have fun =)
